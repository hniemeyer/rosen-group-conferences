Industrial Data Science: Evaluation of Pipeline Inspection Data
===============================================================

In situations where unlabeled data is abundant but labeled data cannot
be obtained easily active learning can be utilized to build classifiers
by intelligently querying users for labels. This talk shows the core
concepts and algorithms of active learning based on a real-world
project. Further focus of the talk is the application of deep learning
methodologies onto real world problems for EMAT anomaly detection.

From 2006 to 2010 Dr. Hendrik Niemeyer has studied at the University of Osnabrück and
obtained his bachelor's and master's degree in Physics. In 2013 he got his PhD in
Theoretical Physics at the University of Osnabrück with his research called "The
approach to equilibration in Closed Quantum Systems". Since 2013 he has been a Data
Scientist at ROSEN working on solving computer vision problems in pipeline inspection
data and numerous other topics.

Dr. Stephan Eule got his PhD in Theoretical Physics in 2008 from the University
of Muenster with a thesis on "Anomalous Diffusion in Complex Systems". After that
he worked as a Postdoc at the Max-Planck-Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization,
where he became a group leader in 2010. His group "Statistical Analysis and Stochastic
Modeling of Complex Systems" worked on various topics ranging from computational
biology over statistical finance to the modeling of infectious diseases, often with
methods that would now be "Data Science". In 2015, he spent some months at the Harvard
Medical School as visiting scientist. Quite recently (October 2018), he joined ROSEN as
a Data Scientist.

Description
-----------

As a service provider to the pipeline industry ROSEN gathers large amounts of measurement
data with the task to ensure the safety of pipeline operations. In order to cope with the
underlying pattern recognition problems, we employ machine learning, deep learning and computer
vision techniques. We will present how we structure our data and solve classification and
regression problems on pipeline inspection data coming from different non-destructive testing
measurement technologies like induced ultrasound (EMAT) and magnetic flux leakage (MFL). Since
in this industrial context predictions need to have a high accuracy we developed methods for
coping with small amounts of verified ground truth data and ensuring the quality of our data
science solutions.

A similar talk was given at the PyCon.DE 2018 conference. Although the
targeted audience was a different one, descriptions and explanations still
hold true. Below you can find the recording of that talk.
