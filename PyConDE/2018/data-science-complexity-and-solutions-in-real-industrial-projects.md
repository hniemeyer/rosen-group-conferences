Data science complexity and solutions in real industrial projects
=================================================================

Due to the complexity associated with data, using machine learning in
real-world scenarios is difficult. Iâ€™d like to give an insight into how
we tackle this task based on examples of real projects in an industrial
environment.

Artur Miller works as Data Scientist for ROSEN Technology & Research
Center in Lingen, Germany. He has a M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. His
main tasks are solving machine learning-, optimization- and robotics
problems. He likes spending his time writing Python code and blogging
about real world machine learning problems.


Description
-----------

As data scientists we usually like to apply fancy machine learning
models to well-groomed datasets. Everyone working on industrial problems
will eventually learn, that this does not reflect reality. The amount of
time spent on modeling is small compared to data gathering, -warehousing
and -cleaning. Even after training and deployment of the model, the work
is not done. Continuous monitoring of the performance and input data is
still necessary.

In this talk I discuss how important data handling is for successful
data science projects. Each milestone, from finding the business case to
continuously monitoring the performance of the solution, is addressed.
This is exemplary shown on a project, with the goal of improving a
productive system.
